## MasterPortal 3.0.0

After more than two years of refactorings we can proudly present the new major Release Masterportal 3.0.0! We completely removed backbonejs and jquery, moved to vue3 and vuex4 and rewrote the application-core. We redesigned the UI to match all the different usecases and usergroups. We have nearly all modules and tools working but still some work to do. Features still to be added/moved to the new version are the following:

* New Draw Module
* Different AddOns
* Theming
* Touchtable-UI
* Performance
* etc.

To try out the new version just checkout this tag and run "npm install" and "npm start". You'll find working configs under "portal" as usual.

Please be aware of the following:

**We appreciate hints, feedback and communication of bugs! Please use the Issuetracker and tag your issue with "v3.0.0"**
